# Mask-Detection Using YOLOv4 Darknet Framework
In a bid to learn something new, I tried training the YOLOv4 model with the Darknet Framework using Linux commands. This was something new for me as I had usually trained CV Models using TF or PyTorch.

The YOLOv4 Model used here has a darknet framework and hence is trained using Linux Commands. The Model accurately detects whether or not a person has worn his mask.
